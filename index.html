A woman made entirely of water spoke to Perloo like she had always known him. She dropped her wet hand on Perloo’s shoulder and said, “The world is always as it is, and always as it seems.” And Perloo believed her, (not really, though: inside of Perloo’s head were a hundred mole-men, shuffling about in blue business suits. Most of the time, they busily accomplished the tasks of managing Perloo’s brain. Sometimes they found peculiar Thoughts. The moles happened upon them while cleaning out the dusty corners of his cerebral cortex. They’d shake them off, then toss them around for each mole to examine. Going from mole-hand to mole-hand, those Thoughts bounced around sometimes for weeks.<img src="/images/mole.png" /> The moles worked incessantly, though, to an echoed murmur. It was the sound of everything that Perloo’s ears picked up. Whenever Perloo heard a credible idea, the moles would all stop for a moment to hum, nodding happily in agreement- and on grand occasions, sometimes shaking each other’s hands and adjusting their spectacles. But oh! the racket when a preposterous notion would echo in that hollow room! “Not so! Not so!” a section of the moles would scream, their furry fists in the air. An equal fraction would screech in reply, “It is! It is!” dislodging their spectacles. Sometimes caught between the two, a full half of them would wobble and stare at their own feet. On occasion, though, a small whisper would rustle through their dense congregation until aloud they would roar, “You’ve missed the point!”) and Perloo shook the water from his sleeve as the woman turned back into a black trumpeter swan.
