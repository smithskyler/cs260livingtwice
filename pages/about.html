                <p>
                    I've always had a passion for capturing the essence of a moment. I started with sketches when I was younger, then took up photography in my later youth. I love making people smile!*
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a Senior in Computer Science, minoring in Business Management. For the past 3 years, I've been working for Start Studio in Provo, making professional iOS applications for entrepreneurs and Utah businesses. After graduating in April, I plan to continue developing iOS apps.

                        *I'm not actually a photographer, but I do enjoy making people smile.
