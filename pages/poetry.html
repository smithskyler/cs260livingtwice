                <h2>Ode to Bo</h2>
                <h3>By Skyler Smith</h3>
                <p>
Through the scorching hot sun walked Sam rather slow,<br />
For all through the night he had lugged his friend Bo.<br />
Flung up o’er his shoulder all dead and quite limp<br />
For his poor friend old Bo had dropped from a blimp.<br />
<br />
Then the vultures came circling and asked our mate Sam,<br />
“Could we eat Bo all up, since he is a dead man?”<br />
“Why no!” replied Sam in a terrible fright,<br />
“For Bo is my friend, and I’ll put up a fight!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, no need for violence, we’ll be your friends too,”<br />
A vulture replied without hullabaloo,<br />
“But Bo, my good friend, is a weight on your back,<br />
“And does you no good, but to us is a snack.”<br />
<br />
“He is rather heavy,” said Sam with a frown,<br />
“I guess you can have the ears from his crown.”<br />
“Oh yes!” cried the vultures; they moved in on Bo,<br />
And ate up the ears, then our Sam called, “Now go!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, please,” said the vultures, “Bo’s ears were quite small.<br />
“His feet look alright, ‘sides, they broke from his fall.”<br />
“Alright,” said our Sam, then they ate up Bo’s feet,<br />
Then his hands, then his arms, and even his seat.<br />
<br />
“Now you’ve finished him off,” said Sam with a moan,<br />
As the vultures picked the last meat from his bones.<br />
Then all of a sudden Sam stood up and grinned,<br />
For the weight he had carried was dust in the wind.<br />

                <h2>Unbound</h2>
                <h3>By Skyler Smith</h3>
                <p>
My feet are crossed, my hands are tied,<br />
But I can not, will not, forsake my pride.<br />
The shadows deepen, the pains increase,<br />
My captor's hands push down my knees.<br />
<br />
And there between the door or noose<br />
I have but claim a lie is truth<br />
Then win my freedom, for this they said,<br />
"Two liars alive are worth one dead."<br />
<br />
I shake my head and raise it high,<br />
A prayer, a whisper, an echoed sigh.<br />
A flash of iron, I fight the club,<br />
But hear no sound from the drips of blood.<br />
<br />
My arms are cut, my neck is bruised,<br />
Cold chains about my wrists are used.<br />
They lead me towards my fate, I know<br />
But seeds of freedom do I sow.<br />
<br />
A future now my eyes can see,<br />
When there will be no bended knee,<br />
No bloody fists, no broken necks,<br />
No ropes to bind the aching chests.<br />
<br />
And now my weakness falls to doom,<br />
But there I see a waking bloom,<br />
When fingers snatch from concrete ground,<br />
These seeds I sow, these seeds unbound.<br />
