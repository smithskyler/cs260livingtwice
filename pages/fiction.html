                <h2>A Few Thoughts about a Friend</h2>
                <h3>By Skyler Smith</h3>
                <p>
                    <img src="/images/norway.jpeg" />
                    	Åse pulls off to the side of a winding road in the Norwegian islands, just behind a steep grassy hill. It’s sunny and chill; silvery crystals of frost crawl along the edge of her car’s windows. She turns the keys out of the ignition and her blaring music cuts off with a click. The air stiffens in the sudden silence. Alone now in the quiet, her thoughts start returning to her. She pictures her friend Svinn lying awake in a hospital bed, his sharp eyes staring at her. She doesn’t know if he’ll live. She clenches the steering wheel and presses her eyelids shut until they sting. Her head droops, and she collapses against the wheel, her golden, braided hair falling past her ear. With her hands close to her face, she notices the scent of sanitizing solution that still clings to them coldly like an unwanted memory.
                </p>
                <p>
	“You’re going to change this place, Åse,” Svinn had said when they were teenagers, “I know it.”
                    </p>
                <p>
	She shook her head, “I don’t think they want it changed. I don’t think they want me here either. They’re all so dumb and simple and happy with their dull lives. I hate Gimsøy. I can’t wait to get off this island.”
                    </p>
                <p>
	“They do want you here. Everyone looks up to you.”
                    </p>
                <p>
	“They don’t,” she replied with needles in her voice, “They look up to you. They trust you. I get the feeling that’s the only reason they put up with me.”
                    </p>
                <p>
	Åse lifts herself from the steering wheel with effort, and slides a dark leather sack out from under the passenger seat. Pushing the door open, she can hear the ambient sounds of rustling grass and the muffled hum of the icy ocean, and it makes her feel less alone. The wind whips at her face and hair as she steps out of the car. She climbs her way into the hills and finds the stone that she’s looking for. It protrudes from the ground in the center of a small clearing. She kneels beside it in the grass and retrieves a long piece of chalk from her bag. She can’t stop her hands from trembling. She starts drawing a few white lines on the blank surface of the stone, trying to focus.
                    </p>
                <p>
	Åse slipped out of her room’s window and scrambled down onto the roof. In a few silent seconds, she was on the back lawn. She knew that her parents hadn’t heard her. She went to see Svinn. She figured he’d be upset and maybe even start avoiding her to preserve his own moral spotlessness, but she didn’t care.
                    </p>
                <p>
	“I thought you were grounded,” Svinn reprimanded in hushed tones.
                    </p>
                <p>
	Åse grinned and said, “I can do what I want,” but because of way he looked at her, she felt guilty.
                    </p>
                <p>
	“Why did you sneak out?”
                    </p>
                <p>
	“Just to see if I could.”
                    </p>
                <p>
	“You’re not like that. What’s wrong?”
                    </p>
                <p>
	“What if I am like that, Svinn? What if I don’t care about anyone here? I’m tired of being controlled. I want to live my own life.”
                    </p>
                <p>
	“Do you feel like your parent’s are controlling you?”
                    </p>
                <p>
	“Them, and everyone else. They can’t keep me in anymore. I’m going to do what I want. I won’t let them stop me.”
                    </p>
                <p>
	Svinn looked sad as he smiled, like the smile almost hurt, “Åse…” In an instant, her frustration melted into tears, and she let Svinn put his arms around her. “I hope you’ll feel better.”
                    </p>
                <p>
	The wind is dying down as Åse traces the last lines on the stone. She replaces the chalk into the leather sack, and shakes the bag until she finds a hammer and chisel. She positions the chisel carefully under the first faint white line and hefts the hammer to carve the beginning rune.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    Åse began rune-carving about year ago. She heard of a man named Erik the Red who was replicating the runes of ancient Norwegians, and putting his stone carvings on display. Modern rune-carving intrigued her the first time she heard of it. She remembered being told about the famed Gimsøy stone, which dated to the 10th century, and that had been taken away to the Tromsø museum. Fueled by new curiosity, she started researching the history of the Vikings. It fascinated her that that ancient people had cut their lives out of the Norwegian archipelago that was now her home. It had been a hostile and ferocious landscape, but they redeemed it. She was struck by that redemption. <img src="/images/carving.jpg" /><span class="attribution">"Polski" by Dagny</span>
                    </p>
                <p>
	Åse undid her hair and let it blow as her father’s stolen car took her down the winding roads towards the coast. “Gosh, I’ve been wanting to do this so long,” she sang to herself, gazing towards the horizon. Sirens flared up behind her, and Åse tried to speed up the car, but the police caught up with her long before she reached land’s end.
                    </p>
                <p>
	“Why didn’t you tell me you were leaving?” Svinn asked, “I would have gone with you.”
                    </p>
                <p>
	She thought, You couldn’t, you have leukemia. You go to hospital every other week, but what she said was, “I didn’t want you to come,” and it was partially true. She was trying to see Svinn less those days. She imagined that it was because she had stopped caring what he thought about her, and that she was tired of him believing in her, and thinking that she would change. It didn’t stop him though, and he always made sure to check up on her whenever they crossed ways. He made a point of crossing ways.
                    </p>
                <p>
	A few years later she did finally leave Gimsøy. She bought a car and drove away alone. She told them she wasn’t ever coming back. She took a ferry to the mainland, and found an inexpensive studio in downtown Narvik. With a substantial bank loan, she started up a craft store not far from where she lived. It was small, but had a long display window that faced the roadway. Starting a business was exciting to her, and she was confident that she would succeed. The people didn’t come, though. At first, she barely made enough money to pay the rent on her store, and had to give up her studio. She slept in her chair and dreamed that it would go better.
                    </p>
                <p>
	In September of that year she defaulted on her bank loans and was forced to sell her car. Business didn’t improve, and the next month she lost the store. As she locked the door on the final evening, she realized that she had nowhere to go. She was friendless and penniless, and the weather was turning colder. She slept on the concrete steps of her store’s doorway, protected from the frigid wind by the entryway’s walls. As the nights got colder, desperation and fear birthed in her a gnawing need to survive. She twitched covetously at heated cars and houses, and at filled grocery bags.
                    </p>
                <p>
	Then she crouched on the ice through a freezing December night in the doorway of what used to be her craft store. Now its shelves were lined with boxes of cigarettes, and cheap magazines decorated its stands, and she thought how warm it would still be on the other side. She closed her eyes and wished that some friend would come and help her. Her thoughts drifted to Gimsøy, and she thought of Svinn. But she was alone, and her limbs were becoming stiff in the numbing air. She stared at the store’s glass window and craved the shelter inside. Her eyes caught onto a folded metal chair, its hinges mostly compromised, abandoned in the debris that drifted in the roadway. And she thought of smashing the window, but she knew she would go to jail.
                    </p>
                <p>
	Then her need to survive aroused in her the horrible idea that it would be warm in jail too. And Åse forced her body out of the doorway and towards the rusted chair. Its frozen surface bit at her skin, but she lifted it and swung it hard against the glass of the display window. The window cracked and the security alarm set immediately into a deafening wail. It wasn’t enough. She swung again, and broken lines shot across the surface of the glass. On the third swing, the metal chair flew through the window and the glass exploded in a thousand shards. The inside of the store had hardly been disrupted. Åse picked up the chair again and unfolded it. It wasn’t strong, but it held. She set it up in front of the window, sat, and waited as the police sirens got louder and louder.
                    </p>
                <p>
	After two days in her cell, warm and fed, Åse started returning to herself. Four months would have her released when winter was ending, and when she got out she would be able to try again, get a job, restart. Four months.
                    </p>
                <p>
	Her time in prison was cruel. No matter how minor their offences, the guards treated the inmates like dogs, and the inmates acted like they were. There were no loyalties among them. She noticed how they tried to catch each other in misbehaviour, and shorten their own sentences by reporting it. By the end of the first month, the cold outside seemed more appealing than the hate inside.
                    </p>
                <p>
	She began to notice a weary-looking woman who always sat alone in the lunch room. She looked to be in her late thirties. As Åse watched her, she noticed that the woman would hide her applesauce cup in her lap to open it, and when it reappeared, the tin-foil top would be missing. After a week, Åse reported her. They searched the woman’s cell, and found an intricate tin-foil figurine of a little girl.
                    </p>
                <p>
	They took two months off Åse’s sentence. They added a year to the woman’s. At dinner a following evening, Åse heard the woman whimper quietly to herself, “Jessica… Jessica… My little girl…”
                    </p>
                <p>
	It was a lonely night. Crouched against the concrete wall of her cell, her face in her hands, Åse clubbed at her thoughts again and again. I’m hurting people, she repeated. Ceaseless images of a motherless girl, and a daughterless woman clutching a tin-foil doll harrowed her mind. Then she beat herself with thoughts of her failed business and the window she smashed without caring about the damage, and she began to cry. Hot tears squeezed out of her eyes and onto her hands. She wanted to be in pain. A guard approached the cell door, and she tried to quickly wipe her tears away.
                    </p>
                <p>
	The door opened and the guard walked in, then another man, tall and blond. Svinn.
	Åse stood up in an instant. Svinn looked sad as he moved into the cell and up to Åse, but glancing at his eyes she seemed to see her reflection, and it was more beautiful than she thought it should have been. She pushed him back and challenged, “Why are you here?”
                    </p>
                <p>
	He paused and met her eyes.
                    </p>
                <p>
	“Why do you still believe in me?” She asked.
                    </p>
                <p>
	Svinn hesitated, then tried, “Don’t you?”
                    </p>
                <p>
	Her hands and face still wet with tears, she stared at the angelic reflection in Svinn’s eyes and contempt built inside of her. “Svinn, I’m a bad person! You don’t get it - I’m never going to be what you want me to be-”
                    </p>
                <p>
	Svinn tried to hold her and said, “It’ll be okay, Åse. I know you’ll figure it out.”
                    </p>
                <p>
	She recoiled and forced him off. The guard grabbed Svinn’s arm and started pulling him out of the room. He didn’t resist. As he slid back through the door, Åse called at him, “Leave me alone!”
                    </p>
                <p>
	When she got out of prison a month later, her falling out with Svinn still troubled her. That’s probably why rune-carving became so important. The cold wild had been transformed by the people who first carved them, and Åse started to wonder if things could really be transformed. She wondered if people could. The year following her release, she tried to learn to carve runes, and she managed a reliable income by selling her work to clubs and businesses, but she didn’t hear from Svinn.
                    </p>
                <p>
	Tiny shards of rock explode from under Ase’s hands as her chisel bounces again off the stone, revealing an Old Nordic character near completion. The first word is almost done, and she involuntarily remembers a call that she received two days ago. The nurse on the other end told her that Svinn’s leukemia had gotten worse. She asked if he would get better, but the woman didn’t answer. Åse’s hands were shaking when she put the phone down. On her short flight to Gimsøy, she tried to decide what she would do when she saw him, and what she would say. All that came to her mind was their last brief conversation. When she entered the hospital room, she heard the beep of the heart monitor and smelled the odour of sanitizing solution. Svinn was lying on a white bed. A stiff sheet covered most of his body, and a thin stream of morning light played across it. He was clean, but sickly. Åse stared at him from across the room. Most of his blond hair had fallen out. His skin was pale, maybe almost green, and his face was turned. Åse was frozen there. This wasn’t Svinn. She couldn’t believe that it was. Like a granite bowling ball, Svinn’s head rolled over, and his tired, piercing eyes met Åse’s. She could hardly bear to meet his gaze, but she wouldn’t look away. She wanted to be able to tell him that she was changing, and that he could be proud of her. She wanted to run over and hold him and say that it would be okay. From the hospital bed, Svinn’s eyes bore deep into hers, but the reflection in them was sad. She wished that if there was anything that could be done to heal him, she could do it. Svinn didn’t say anything, he only smiled, like it hurt.
                    </p>
                <p>
	Åse’s chisel shakes on the stone face as she finishes carving the last rune of the first word. It’s jagged, but clear. In Old Norse it reads ‘Loss.’ In Norwegian, it would read, ‘Svinn.’ <img src="/images/tools.jpg"/>
